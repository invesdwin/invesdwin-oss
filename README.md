# invesdwin-oss
This is just a simplification for the continuous integration setup. Also to provide an easier way to checkout all these projects at once. Use the following command to keep your checkout updated (always following master head):

    bash pull.sh
    
Note that you can also put this into your .mrconfig to let [myrepos](https://myrepos.branchable.com/) handle updates properly for you.

Please do not follow the links to the submodule projects in the github explorer, since they most likely point to outdated revisions of those projects. Rather access the projects directly to get to the current revision.
