# invesdwin-oss
The one project to build em all! Mostly just a simplification for the continuous integration setup. Also to provide an easier way to checkout all these projects at once. Use the following command to keep your checkout updated:

    git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
    
Note that you can also put this into your .mrconfig to let [My Repos](https://myrepos.branchable.com/) handle updates properly for you.
